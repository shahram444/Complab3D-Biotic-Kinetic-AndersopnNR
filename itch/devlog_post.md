# From Research Simulator to Game

I work on pore-scale biogeochemical reactive transport — a mouthful that basically means: simulating how tiny microbes live, eat, grow, and form colonies inside the microscopic water-filled gaps between grains of soil and rock, deep underground.

My research tool, **CompLaB3D**, couples fluid dynamics (Lattice Boltzmann Method), microbial growth kinetics (Monod model), equilibrium chemistry (Newton-Raphson), and cellular automata biofilm expansion in full 3D. It's powerful, but explaining what it does — even to other scientists in different fields — has always been a challenge.

How do you show someone what happens at a scale they can't see, governed by equations they may not know?

**You let them play it.**

ARKE takes the core science from CompLaB3D and turns it into a game. The flow fields are real. The growth kinetics are real. The pore geometry is real. You're not just playing — you're experiencing what a methanotrophic archaeon does every day: navigating flow, finding food, growing, dividing, and trying to keep greenhouse gases from escaping into the atmosphere.

I hope ARKE can serve as a bridge — between researchers and the public, between disciplines, and between the classroom and the lab. If you're a teacher, feel free to use it. If you're a scientist, I hope it gives you a new way to see the subsurface. If you're just here to play — welcome to the pore world.
